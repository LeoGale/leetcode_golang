## Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
## Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

* Example 1:
> nums1 = [1, 3]
  nums2 = [2]
  The median is 2.0

* Example 2:
> nums1 = [1, 2]
 nums2 = [3, 4]
 The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
